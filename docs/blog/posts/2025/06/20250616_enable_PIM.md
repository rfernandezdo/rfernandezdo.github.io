# Streamline Your Workflow: Activate All Your PIM Roles with a Single Script Using the JAz.PIM Module

For professionals working with Azure, Privileged Identity Management (PIM) is a cornerstone of robust security hygiene. PIM enables just-in-time access to privileged roles, but manually activating multiple roles each morning can quickly become a repetitive and time-consuming task.

Fortunately, the PowerShell community provides powerful tools to automate such processes. This article introduces a script leveraging the **`JAz.PIM`** module, an excellent solution developed by [Justin Grote](https://github.com/JustinGrote/), to simplify and accelerate role activation.

While the script is straightforward, its effectiveness is remarkable.

```powershell
# Check if the JAz.PIM module is installed; if not, install it
if (-not (Get-module -ListAvailable -Name JAz.PIM)) {
    Install-Module -Name JAz.PIM -Force -Scope CurrentUser
}

# Import the JAz.PIM module if it is not already loaded in the session
if (-not (Get-module -Name JAz.PIM)) {
    Import-module JAz.PIM
}

# Verify Azure login status; if not logged in, initiate login
if (-not (Get-AzContext)) {
    Connect-AzAccount
}

# Set the default activation duration for roles to 8 hours
$PSDefaultParameterValues['Enable-JAz*Role:Hours'] = 8

# Retrieve and activate all eligible roles (Azure Resource and/or Azure AD roles)
Get-JAzRole | Enable-JAzRole -Justification "Administrative task"
```

This script ensures the `JAz.PIM` module is installed, connects to Azure if necessary, and activates all your eligible roles in a single command.

Key components:
* `Get-JAzRole`: This cmdlet from the `JAz.PIM` module retrieves all roles for which you are eligible.
* `Enable-JAzRole`: This command processes each role in the list, submitting an activation request with the specified justification.

Notably, **`JAz.PIM` can manage both Azure Resource roles (Owner, Contributor, etc.) and Azure AD roles (Global Administrator, etc.)**.

## Conclusion

Automation is essential for optimizing daily administrative tasks. This script, powered by the community-driven `JAz.PIM` module, exemplifies how a manual, repetitive process can be transformed into a quick and efficient command. Adopting such tools not only saves time but also helps maintain PIM security best practices with minimal friction.
