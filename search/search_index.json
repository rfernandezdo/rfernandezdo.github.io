The security controls that should be applied include user and network access control, data encryption at-rest and in-transit. Use multi-factor-authentication and Azure RBAC to secure the critical Azure Backup operations (such as delete, change retention, updates to backup config). For Azure Backup supported resources, use Azure RBAC to segregate duties and enable fine grained access, and create private endpoints within your Azure Virtual Network to securely backup and restore data from your Recovery Services vaults. Overview of security features in Azure Backup: Use AWS IAM access control to secure AWS Backup. This includes securing the AWS Backup service access and backup and restore points. Example controls include: Security in AWS Backup: Security architecture: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-architecture CP-9: INFORMATION SYSTEM BACKUP https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/security-overview - Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical operations such as deletion of a backup/restore point. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/security-considerations.html For Azure Backup supported resources, backup data is automatically encrypted using Azure platform-managed keys with 256-bit AES encryption. You can also choose to encrypt the backups using a customer managed key. In this case, ensure the customer-managed key in the Azure Key Vault is also in the backup scope. If you use a customer-managed key, use soft delete and purge protection in Azure Key Vault to protect keys from accidental or malicious deletion. For on-premises backups using Azure Backup, encryption-at-rest is provided using the passphrase you provide. - Use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) to communicate with AWS resources. Infrastructure and endpoint security: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-infrastructure-endpoint Encryption of backup data using customer-managed keys: - Use AWS KMS in conjunction with AWS Backup to encrypt the backup data either using customer-managed CMK or an AWS-managed CMK associated with the AWS Backup service. Security Best Practices for Amazon S3: Safeguard backup data from accidental or malicious deletion, such as ransomware attacks/attempts to encrypt or tamper backup data. For Azure Backup supported resources, enable soft delete to ensure recovery of items with no data loss for up to 14 days after an unauthorized deletion, and enable multifactor authentication using a PIN generated in the Azure portal. Also enable geo-redundant storage or cross-region restoration to ensure backup data is restorable when there is a disaster in primary region. You can also enable Zone-redundant Storage (ZRS) to ensure backups are restorable during zonal failures. https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/encryption-at-rest-with-cmk - Use AWS Backup Vault Lock for immutable storage of critical data. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/security-best-practices.html Incident preparation: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-incident-preparation - Secure S3 buckets through access policy, disabling public access, enforcing data at-rest encryption, and versioning control.

IM-3 Identity Management nan nan AC-2: ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT N/A Manage application identities securely and automatically Use managed application identities instead of creating human accounts for applications to access resources and execute code. Managed application identities provide benefits such as reducing the exposure of credentials. Automate the rotation of credentials to ensure the security of the identities. Use Azure managed identities, which can authenticate to Azure services and resources that support Azure AD authentication. Managed identity credentials are fully managed, rotated, and protected by the platform, avoiding hard-coded credentials in source code or configuration files. Azure managed identities: Use AWS IAM roles instead of creating user accounts for resources that support this feature. IAM roles are managed by the platform at the backend and the credentials are temporary and rotated automatically. This avoids creating long-term access keys or a username/password for applications and hard-coded credentials in source code or configuration files.

The most common server authentication protocol is Transport Layer Security (TLS), where the client-side (often a browser or client device) verifies the server by verifying the server\u2019s certificate was issued by a trusted certificate authority. Many Azure services support TLS authentication by default. For services that don't support this by default or support TLS disabling, ensure it is always enabled to support the server/service authentication. Your client application should also be designed to verify server/service identity (by verifying the server\u2019s certificate issued by a trusted certificate authority) in the handshake stage. Enforce Transport Layer Security (TLS) for a storage account: Many AWS services support TLS authentication by default.

The most critical built-in roles in Azure AD are Global Administrator and Privileged Role Administrator, because users assigned to these two roles can delegate administrator roles. With these privileges, users can directly or indirectly read and modify every resource in your Azure environment: The privileged/administrative users need to be secured include: Security architecture: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-architecture - Global Administrator / Company Administrator: Users with this role have access to all administrative features in Azure AD as well as services that use Azure AD identities. Use Azure Privileged Identity Management security alerts: - Root user: Root user is the highest-level privileged accounts in your AWS account. Root accounts should be highly restricted and only used in emergency situation. Refer to emergency access controls in PA-5 (Setup emergency access). - Privileged Role Administrator: Users with this role can manage role assignments in Azure AD, as well as within Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM). In addition, this role allows management of all aspects of PIM and administrative units. https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-how-to-configure-security-alerts - IAM identities (users, groups, roles) with the privileged permission policy: IAM identities assigned with a permission policy such as AdministratorAccess can have full access to AWS services and resources. Security Compliance Management: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-compliance-management Outside of Azure AD, Azure has built-in roles that can be critical for privileged access at the resource level. Securing privileged access for hybrid and cloud deployments in Azure AD: If you are using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) as the identity provider for AWS, refer to the Azure guidance for managing the privileged roles in Azure AD. Security Operations: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-operations-center - Owner: Grants full access to manage all resources, including the ability to assign roles in Azure RBAC. https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-admin-roles-secure - Contributor: Grants full access to manage all resources, but does not allow you to assign roles in Azure RBAC, manage assignments in Azure Blueprints, or share image galleries. Ensure that you also restrict privileged accounts in other management, identity, and security systems that have administrative access to your business-critical assets, such as AWS Cognito, security tools, and system management tools with agents installed on business critical systems. Attackers who compromise these management and security systems can immediately weaponize them to compromise business critical assets. - User Access Administrator: Lets you manage user access to Azure resources. Note: You may have other critical roles that need to be governed if you use custom roles in the Azure AD level or resource level with certain privileged permissions assigned. In addition, users with the following three roles in Azure Enterprise Agreement (EA) portal should also be restricted as they can be used to directly or indirectly manage Azure subscriptions. - Account Owner: Users with this role can manage subscriptions, including the creation and deletion of subscriptions. - Enterprise Administrator: Users assigned with this role can manage (EA) portal users. - Department Administrator: Users assigned with this role can change account owners within the department. Lastly, ensure that you also restrict privileged accounts in other management, identity, and security systems that have administrative access to your business-critical assets, such as Active Directory Domain Controllers (DCs), security tools, and system management tools with agents installed on business-critical systems. Attackers who compromise these management and security systems can immediately weaponize them to compromise business critical assets. PA-2 Privileged Access nan nan AC-2: ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT N/A Avoid standing access for user accounts and permissions Instead of creating standing privileges, use just-in-time (JIT) mechanism to assign privileged access to the different resource tiers. Enable just-in-time (JIT) privileged access to Azure resources and Azure AD using Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM). JIT is a model in which users receive temporary permissions to perform privileged tasks, which prevents malicious or unauthorized users from gaining access after the permissions have expired. Access is granted only when users need it. PIM can also generate security alerts when there is suspicious or unsafe activity in your Azure AD organization. Azure PIM just-in-time access deployment: Use AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) to create temporary security credentials to access the resources through the AWS API. Temporary security credentials work almost identically to the long-term access key credentials that your IAM users can use, with the following differences: IAM Temporary credentials through AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS): Identity and key management: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-identity-keys https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-deployment-plan - Temporary security credentials have a short-term life, from minutes to hours. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html Restrict inbound traffic to your sensitive virtual machines (VM) management ports with Microsoft Defender for Cloud's just-in-time (JIT) for VM access feature. This ensures privileged access to the VM is granted only when users need it. - Temporary security credentials are not stored with the user but are generated dynamically and provided to the user when requested.

To prevent being accidentally locked out of your Azure AD organization, set up an emergency access account (e.g., an account with Global Administrator role) for access when normal administrative accounts cannot be used. Emergency access accounts are usually highly privileged, and they should not be assigned to specific individuals. Emergency access accounts are limited to emergency or \"break glass\"' scenarios where normal administrative accounts can't be used. Manage emergency access accounts in Azure AD: AWS \"root\" accounts should not be used for regular administrative tasks. As the \"root\" account is highly privileged, it should not be assigned to specific individuals. It's use should be limited to only emergency or \"break glass\u201d scenarios when normal administrative accounts can't be used. For daily administrative tasks, separate privileged user accounts should be used and assigned the appropriate permissions via IAM roles. Best practices to protect your account's root user: Identity and key management: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-identity-keys https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-emergency-access https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/best-practices-root-user.html Emergency access accounts should be rarely used and can be highly damaging to the organization if compromised, but their availability to the organization is also critically important for the few scenarios when they are required. You should ensure that the credentials (such as password, certificate, or smart card) for emergency access accounts are kept secure and known only to individuals who are authorized to use them only in an emergency. You may also use additional controls, such dual controls (e.g., splitting the credential into two pieces and giving it to separate persons) to enhance the security of this process. You should also monitor the sign-in and audit logs to ensure that emergency access accounts are only used when authorized. You should also ensure that the credentials (such as password, MFA tokens and access keys) for root accounts are kept secure and known only to individuals who are authorized to use them only in an emergency. MFA should be enabled for the root account, and you may also use additional controls, such as dual controls (e.g., splitting the credential into two pieces and giving it to separate persons) to enhance the security of this process.

Use features such as role-based access control (RBAC) to manage resource access through role assignments. Use Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to manage Azure resource access through role assignments. Through RBAC, you can assign roles to users, groups, service principals, and managed identities. There are pre-defined built-in roles for certain resources, and these roles can be inventoried or queried through tools such as Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, and the Azure portal. What is Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC): Use AWS policy to manage AWS resource access. There are six types of policies: identity-based policies, resource-based policies, permissions boundaries, AWS Organizations service control policy (SCP), Access Control List, and session policies. You may use AWS managed policies for common permission use cases. However, you should be mindful that managed policies may carry excessive permissions that should not be assigned to the users.

Limited privileges will complement the just-in-time (JIT) approach of Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM), and those privileges should be reviewed periodically. If required, you can also use PIM to define a time-bound assignment, which is a condition in a role assignment where a user can only activate the role within the specified start and end dates. You may also use AWS ABAC (attribute-based access control) to assign permissions based on attributes (tags) attached to IAM resources, including IAM entities (users or roles) and AWS resources.

For the web version of the content, please refer to ttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/overview nan a. The control mappings between MCSB and industry benchmarks (such as NIST, CIS and PCI) only indicate that a specific Azure feature can be used to fully or partially address a control requirement defined in NIST, CIS or PCI. You should be aware that such implementation does not necessarily translate to the full compliance of the corresponding control in CIS, NIST or PCI. b. This document is developed as a reference and should not be used to define all means by which a customer can meet specific compliance requirements and regulations. Customers should seek legal support from their organization on approved customer implementations. nan nan nan nan This multi-cloud guidance follows the below principles: nan 1. The security guidance for non-Azure platforms will follow the same cloud-neutral security principles at each control level as Azure's. 2. The security guidance for non-Azure platforms will provide the same level of granularity and same scope in the technical guidance as Azure's. 3. The non-Microsoft cloud service provider\u2019s (CSP) native solution or feature will usually be recommended as the first preference for each control. However, when there is a more mature multi-cloud solution available in Azure, it'll be prioritized as the default recommendation. 4. If neither the CSP's native technology nor Azure solutions are available to satisfy a security principle, third-party solutions will be recommended from the Azure or the other CSP's Marketplace. However, Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark will not name any specific third-party vendor product or solution. nan nan nan nan nan nan nan Guidance  - Column Header Descriptions nan ID# The Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark ID. nan Control Domain The security control domain. nan Security Principle The technology-agnostic and cloud neutral principle for various security topics in each control domains. nan Recommendation The control recommendation in summarized format. nan Azure Guidance The technical guidance for Azure platforms. nan AWS Guidance The technical guidance for Amazon Web Services platforms. nan Implementation and additional context The implementation details and other relevant context which links to the Azure or AWS service offering documentation articles."},{"location":"Tools/Analyze_Virtual_Network_Flows/","title":"Analyze-VNETFlowLogs","text":""},{"location":"Tools/Analyze_Virtual_Network_Flows/#analyze-vnetflowlogs","title":"Analyze-VNETFlowLogs","text":"<p>Analizador de logs de flujo de Azure (VNet).

This practice ensures that you can track changes, collaborate effectively, and roll back to previous versions if needed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Automated Testing: Incorporate policy testing into your CI/CD pipelines. Automated tests can help you catch policy violations early in the development process, reducing the risk of non-compliance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Policy Documentation: Document your policies clearly, including their purpose, scope, and expected behavior. This documentation helps stakeholders understand the policies and their impact on Azure resources.</p> </li> <li> <p>Policy Assignment: Assign policies at the appropriate scope (e.g., Management Group, Subscription, Resource Group) based on your organizational requirements. Avoid assigning policies at a broader scope than necessary to prevent unintended consequences.</p> </li> <li> <p>Policy Exemptions: Use policy exemptions judiciously. Document the reasons for exemptions and periodically review them to ensure they are still valid.</p> </li> <li> <p>Policy Enforcement: Monitor policy compliance regularly and take corrective action for non-compliant resources. Use Azure Policy's built-in compliance reports and alerts to track policy violations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Policy Remediation: Implement automated remediation tasks for policy violations where possible. Azure Policy's remediation tasks can help bring non-compliant resources back into compliance automatically.</p> </li> <li> <p>Policy Monitoring: Continuously monitor policy effectiveness and adjust policies as needed. Regularly review policy violations, exemptions, and compliance trends to refine your policy implementation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Policy Governance: Establish a governance framework for Azure Policy that includes policy creation, assignment, monitoring, and enforcement processes. Define roles and responsibilities for policy management to ensure accountability.</p> </li> <li> <p>Policy Lifecycle Management: Define a policy lifecycle management process that covers policy creation, testing, deployment, monitoring, and retirement. Regularly review and update policies to align with changing organizational requirements.</p> </li> <li> <p>Unique source of truth: Use EPAC, terraform, ARM,.... but use an unique source of truth for your policies.</p> </li> </ol> <p>By following these best practices, you can effectively manage Azure policies and ensure compliance with organizational standards across your Azure environment.

This practice minimizes managerial complexity and overhead.</p> </li> <li> <p>Refrain from mirroring your organizational structure into a deeply nested management group hierarchy. Utilize management groups primarily for policy assignment rather than billing. This strategy aligns with the Azure landing zone conceptual architecture, which applies Azure policies to workloads that need similar security and compliance at the same management group level.</p> </li> <li> <p>Establish management groups under your root-level group representing different types of workloads you will host. These groups should reflect the security, compliance, connectivity, and feature requirements of the workloads. By doing this, you can apply a set of Azure policies at the management group level for all workloads with similar needs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Leverage resource tags for querying and horizontally traversing across the management group hierarchy. Resource tags, enforced or appended via Azure Policy, allow you to group resources for search purposes without relying on a complex management group hierarchy.</p> </li> <li> <p>Set up a top-level sandbox management group. This allows users to immediately experiment with Azure and try out resources not yet permitted in production environments. The sandbox provides isolation from your development, testing, and production settings.</p> </li> <li> <p>Create a platform management group beneath the root management group to support common platform policy and Azure role assignments. This ensures distinct policies can be applied to subscriptions used for your Azure foundation and centralizes billing for common resources in one foundational subscription set.</p> </li> <li> <p>Minimize the number of Azure Policy assignments made at the root management group scope. This reduces the debugging of inherited policies in lower-level management groups.</p> </li> <li> <p>Implement policies to enforce compliance requirements either at the management group or subscription scope to achieve policy-driven governance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ensure only privileged users have operational access to management groups in the tenant. Enable Azure RBAC authorization in the management group hierarchy settings to fine-tune user privileges. By default, all users are authorized to create their own management groups under the root management group.</p> </li> <li> <p>Set up a default, dedicated management group for new subscriptions. This prevents any subscriptions from being placed under the root management group. This is particularly important if there are users eligible for Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) or Visual Studio benefits and subscriptions. A sandbox management group could be a suitable candidate for this type of management group.

With Conditional Access, you can enforce policies that require users to meet certain criteria before they can access resources, such as multi-factor authentication, device compliance, or location-based restrictions.</p> <p>You have three main components in Conditional Access:</p> <ul> <li>Signals: These are the conditions that trigger a policy. Signals can include user sign-in, device state, location, and more.</li> <li>Decisions: These are the actions that are taken when a policy is triggered. Decisions can include requiring multi-factor authentication, blocking access, or granting access with conditions.</li> <li>Enforcement: This is the mechanism that enforces the policy. Enforcement can be done at the application level, the network level, or the device level.</li> </ul> <p>Really, all the Conditional Access policies are based on the following flow:</p> <ol> <li>Assignments: Define who and where the policy applies to.</li> <li>Access Controls: Define what to do when the the who and where are met.</li> </ol> <p>For that reason, we can define the followin phases:</p> <ul> <li>Phase 1: Collect session details</li> <li> <p>Assignments: Define who and where the policy applies to.    </p> <ul> <li>users: users and groups selected and excluded</li> <li>Target resources: Control access base on Cloud apps, actions, and authentication context.</li> <li>Cloud apps: Include and exclude. Many of the existing Microsoft cloud applications are included in the list of applications that can be targeted by Conditional Access policies:  Office 365, Windows Azure Service Management API, Microsoft Admin Portals and Others</li> <li>User actions: Tasks that a user performs: Register security information and Register or join devices</li> <li>Global Secure Access: Targeting members in your tenant with Global Secure Access (GSA) as a resource,enable administrators to define and control how traffic is routed through Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Microsoft Entra Private Access.</li> <li>Authentication context: With this option you can define a authentication context for the policy, for example, you can define that the policy is applied only when the user is accessing to Higly Confidential information. You can create labels with ID c1 to c99 and tag your information with these labels. Not all apps support authentication contexts, you can check the official documentation to see which apps support it.</li> <li>Network: Include and Exclude. Control user access based on their network location or physical location.<ul> <li>Any network or location: This option allows you to apply the policy to all network locations.</li> <li>All trusted locations: This option allows you to apply the policy to all trusted locations.</li> <li>All Compliant Network locations: This option allows you to apply the policy to all compliant network locations.</li> <li>Selected network or location: This option allows you to apply the policy to selected network locations: Countries(GPS),Countries(IP) and IP ranges.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Conditions: Control access based in signals from conditions.<ul> <li>User risk: Control access based on the user risk level calculated by Microsoft Entra Identity Protection. User risk represents the probability that a given identity or account is compromised, for example: Published credentials in Dark Web.</li> <li>Sign-in risk: Control access based on the sign-in risk level calculated by Microsoft Entra Identity Protection. Sign-in risk represents the probability that a given authentication request wasn't made by the identity owner. For example, sign-in from a new location or new device.</li> <li>Insider risk: Control access for users who are assigned specific risk levels from Adaptive Protection, a Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management feature. Insider risk represents the probability that a given user is engaged in risky data-related activities.</li> <li>Device Platform: Include and Exclude. Control access based on the platform of the device used to sign in.</li> <li>Client apps: Include and Exclude. Control access based on the client apps used to sign in.</li> <li>Filters for devices: Include and Exclude. Control access based on configured filters to apply policy to specific devices</li> <li>Authentication flows: Control access based on the authentication flow used to sign in: </li> <li>Device code flow: Device code flow is a method of authentication that allows users to sign in to a device using a code displayed on the device. This flow is used for devices that don't have a browser or can't use a browser to sign in.</li> <li>Authentication transfer: Authentication transfer is a new flow that offers a seamless way to transfer authenticated state from one device to another.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Phase 2: Enforcement</p> </li> <li>Access controls: Define what to do when the the who and where are met.<ul> <li>Grant: Control access enforcement to block or grant access.</li> <li>Block: Block access to the resource.</li> <li>Grant: Grant access to the resource. You can also define the following options:<ul> <li>Require multi-factor authentication: Require users to perform multi-factor authentication.</li> <li>Require authentication strength:  Require a combination of authentication methods to access the resource.</li> <li>Require device to be marked as compliant: Require the device to be marked as compliant by Microsoft Entra Intune.</li> <li>Require Hybrid Azure AD joined device: Require the device to be Hybrid Azure AD joined.</li> <li>Require approved client app: Require the use of an approved client app.</li> <li>Require app protection policy: Require that an Intune app protection policy is present on the client app before access is available to the selected applications</li> <li>Require password change: Require the user to change their password.</li> </ul> </li> <li>For multiple controls, you can define the following options:<ul> <li>Require all the selected controls: Require all the selected controls to be met.</li> <li>Require one of the selected controls: Require one of the selected controls to be met.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Session: Control access based on session controls to enable limited experiences within specific cloud applications.<ul> <li>Use app enforced restrictions: Enforce app restrictions to control access based on the app's own restrictions. When selected, the cloud app uses the device information to provide users with a limited or full experience. Limited when the device isn't managed or compliant and full when the device is managed and compliant.</li> <li>Use Conditional Access App Control: Enforce real-time monitoring and control of user sessions. Conditional Access App Control enables user app access and sessions to be monitored and controlled in real time based on access and session policies. Access and session policies are used within the Defender for Cloud Apps portal to refine filters and set actions to take.</li> <li>Sign-in frequency: Enforce sign-in frequency to control how often users are prompted to sign in. Sign-in frequency setting works with apps that implement OAUTH2 or OIDC protocols according to the standards.</li> <li>Persistent browser session: Enforce persistent browser session to control users can remain signed in after closing and reopening their browser window.</li> <li>Customize continuous access evaluation: Enable custom continuous access evaluation to revoke access tokens based on critical events and policy evaluation in real time.Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE) allows access tokens to be revoked based on critical events and policy evaluation in real time rather than relying on token expiration based on lifetime.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Example of Conditional Access policy configuration:</p> <ol> <li>Block access to all users from all locations except for a specific group of users from a specific location:</li> <li>Assignments:<ul> <li>users: </li> <li>Include:All users</li> <li>Exclude: Group_of_excluded_users</li> <li>Target resources:</li> <li>Cloud apps: All

It helps detect and respond to security threats in real-time.</li> <li>Turn on soft delete for blob data: Soft delete helps protect your blob data from accidental deletion. It allows you to recover deleted data within a specified retention period.</li> <li>Use Microsoft Entitlement Management to authorize access to blob data: Microsoft Entitlement Management provides fine-grained access control for Azure storage accounts. It allows you to define and enforce access policies based on user roles and permissions.</li> <li>Consider the principle of least privilege: When assigning permissions to a Microsoft Entitlement security principal through Azure RBAC, follow the principle of least privilege. Only grant the minimum permissions required to perform the necessary tasks.</li> <li>Use managed identities to access blob and queue data: Managed identities provide a secure way to access Azure storage accounts without storing credentials in your code.</li> <li>Use blob versioning or immutable blobs: Blob versioning and immutable blobs help protect your business-critical data from accidental deletion or modification.</li> <li>Restrict default internet access for storage accounts: Limit default internet access to Azure storage accounts to prevent unauthorized access.</li> <li>Enable firewall rules: Use firewall rules to restrict network access to Azure storage accounts. Only allow trusted IP addresses to access the storage account.</li> <li>Limit network access to specific networks: Limit network access to specific networks or IP ranges to prevent unauthorized access.</li> <li>Allow trusted Microsoft services to access the storage account: Allow only trusted Microsoft services to access the storage account to prevent unauthorized access.</li> <li>Enable the Secure transfer required option: Enable the Secure transfer required option on all your storage accounts to enforce secure connections.</li> <li>Limit shared access signature (SAS) tokens to HTTPS connections only: Limit shared access signature (SAS) tokens to HTTPS connections only to prevent unauthorized access.</li> <li>Avoid using Shared Key authorization: Avoid using Shared Key authorization to access storage accounts. Use Azure AD or SAS tokens instead.</li> <li>Regenerate your account keys periodically: Regenerate your account keys periodically to prevent unauthorized access.</li> <li>Create a revocation plan for SAS tokens: Create a revocation plan and have it in place for any SAS tokens that you issue to clients. This will help you revoke access to the storage account if necessary.</li> <li>Use near-term expiration times on SAS tokens: Use near-term expiration times on impromptu SAS, service SAS, or account SAS to limit the exposure of the token.</li> </ol>","tags":["Azure Storage Account"]},{"location":"blog/2024/06/16/data-threat-modeling-in-azure-storage-accounts/#mixed-strategies-for-data-protection-in-azure-storage-accounts","title":"Mixed strategies for data protection in Azure storage accounts","text":"<p>Diagram of the mixed strategies for data protection in Azure storage accounts:</p> <pre><code>graph LR\n    A[Asset Management] --&gt;B(AM-2)\n    B --&gt;

I recommend using Visual Studio Code, but you can use any other editor. Exists a plugin for Visual Studio Code that helps you to write policies for gatekeeper. You can install it from the marketplace: Open Policy Agent.</p> <p>Once you have your editor ready, you can start writing your policy. In this example, we will create a policy that denies the creation of pods with the image <code>nginx:latest</code>.</p> <p>For that we need two files:</p> <ul> <li><code>constraint.yaml</code>: This file defines the constraint that we want to apply.</li> <li><code>constraint_template.yaml</code>: This file defines the template that we will use to create the constraint.</li> </ul> <p>Let's start with the <code>constraint_template.yaml</code> file:</p> constraint_template.yaml<pre><code>apiVersion: templates.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1\nkind: ConstraintTemplate\nmetadata:\n  name: k8sdenypodswithnginxlatest\nspec:\n  crd:\n    spec:\n      names:\n        kind: K8sDenyPodsWithNginxLatest\n  targets:\n    - target: admission.k8s.gatekeeper.sh\n      rego: |\n        package k8sdenypodswithnginxlatest\n\n        violation[{\"msg\": msg}] {\n          input.review.object.spec.containers[_].image == \"nginx:latest\"\n          msg := \"Containers cannot use the nginx:latest image\"\n        }\n</code></pre> <p>Now, let's create the <code>constraint.yaml</code> file:</p> constraint.yaml<pre><code>apiVersion: constraints.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1\nkind: K8sDenyPodsWithNginxLatest\nmetadata:\n  name: deny-pods-with-nginx-latest\nspec:\n  match:\n    kinds:\n      - apiGroups: [\"\"]\n        kinds: [\"Pod\"]\n  parameters:\n    msg: \"Containers cannot use the nginx:latest image\"\n</code></pre> <p>Now, we can apply the files to our cluster:</p> <pre><code># Create the constraint template\nkubectl apply -f constraint_template.yaml\n\n# Create the constraint\nkubectl apply -f constraint.yaml\n</code></pre> <p>Now, we can test the constraint. Let's create a pod with the image <code>nginx:latest</code>:</p> <pre><code>cat &lt;&lt;EOF | kubectl apply -f -\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx-pod\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: nginx\n    image: nginx:latest\nEOF\n</code></pre> <p>We must see an error message like this:</p> <pre><code>Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating \"STDIN\": admission webhook \"validation.gatekeeper.sh\" denied the request: [k8sdenypodswithnginxlatest] Containers cannot use the nginx:latest image\n</code></pre> <p>Now, let's create a pod with a different image:</p> <pre><code>cat &lt;&lt;EOF | kubectl apply -f -\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx-pod\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: nginx\n    image: nginx:1.25.5\nEOF\n</code></pre> <p>We must see a message like this:</p> <pre><code>pod/nginx-pod created\n</code></pre> <p>For cleaning up, you can delete pod,the constraint and the constraint template:</p> <pre><code># Delete the pod\nkubectl delete pod nginx-pod\n# Delete the constraint\nkubectl delete -f constraint.yaml\n\n# Delete the constraint template\nkubectl delete -f constraint_template.yaml\n</code></pre> <p>And that's it! We have developed our first policy for Kubernetes with minikube and gatekeeper. Now you can start developing more complex policies and test them in your cluster.</p> <p>Happy coding!</p>","tags":["Azure Policy"]},{"location":"blog/2024/12/12/ejecutar-terraform-con-archivos-de-variables/","title":"Ejecutar Terraform con archivos de variables","text":"","tags":["Terraform"]},{"location":"blog/2024/12/12/ejecutar-terraform-con-archivos-de-variables/#ejecutar-terraform-con-archivos-de-variables","title":"Ejecutar Terraform con archivos de variables","text":"<p>En ocasiones, cuando trabajamos con Terraform, necesitamos gestionar m\u00faltiples archivos de variables para diferentes entornos o configuraciones.

Microsoft To Do is a great tool for managing your tasks and projects, and it integrates seamlessly with Outlook.</p> <p>You can use Outlook to implement the GTD method by following these steps:</p> <ol> <li>Capture:<ul> <li>emails: Use the Inbox to collect everything that has your attention.</li> <li>Other Things: Use Microsoft To Do Taks default list to capture tasks and projects.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Clarify: Process what you've captured by asking yourself the following questions:<ul> <li>What is this?</li> <li>What should I do?</li> <li>Is this really worth doing?</li> <li>How does it fit in with all the other things I have to do?</li> <li>Is there any action that needs to be done about it or because of it?</li> </ul> </li> <li>Organize: Put everything in its place by following these steps:<ul> <li>Inbox:<ul> <li>Move emails to the appropriate folder or delete them.</li> <li>Categories: Use categories to organize your emails by context and folder to organize your emails by project or client.</li> <li>Use search folders to find emails quickly by category or categories, you can clear categories after processing.</li> <li>Flags emails to add to To Do.</li> <li>Create rules to automate repetitive tasks when clarifying one type of email has allways the same action.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Tasks: Organize your tasks and projects in Microsoft To Do.<ul> <li>Lists: Create lists for different types of tasks, one by context or use #tags for that in one lists. For example:<ul> <li>In the case of lists: Agendas, Anywhere, Calls, Computed, Errands, Home, Office, Waiting For, Someday/Maybe.</li> <li>In the case of tags, one list with: #Agendas, #Anywhere, #Calls, #Computed, #Errands, #Home, #Office, #WaitingFor, #SomedayMaybe.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Use tag #nextaction to identify the next task to do.</li> <li>Use tag #urgent to identify urgent tasks.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Projects<ul> <li>Group Lists: Group lists by category of projects or client.</li> <li>One list per project: Create a list for each project and add tasks to it.</li> <li>Use #nextaction tag to identify the next task in each project.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Reference Material:<ul> <li>Store reference material in folders, better in OneDrive or SharePoint.</li> <li>Use a folder structure to organize your reference material</li> <li>Use search folders to find it quickly.</li> <li>Use tags to identify the context of the reference material. You can use FileMeta to add tags to files in Windows for non-taggeable files.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Reflect: Review your system regularly to make sure it's up to date.<ul> <li>Daily Review</li> <li>Weekly Review</li> <li>Monthly Review</li> <li>Annual Review</li> </ul> </li> <li>Engage: Choose what to do and do it.<ul> <li>Use the My Day Bar to see your tasks and events at a glance or in search bar type #nextaction to see all your next actions.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>These are just some ideas to get you started. You can adapt the GTD method to your needs and preferences. The key is to find a system that works for you and stick to it.</p> <p>My example of GTD in Outlook with Microsoft To Do:</p> <p>Outlook:</p> <p></p> <p>To Do:</p> <p></p> <p>I'm using a mix of lists and tags with the same name to organize my tasks and projects. I have lists for different types of tasks, such as Agendas, Anywhere, Calls, Computed, Errands, Home, Office, Waiting For, and Someday/Maybe. I also use tags to identify the next action, urgent tasks and context of the task in projects.</p> <p>In the case of emails, I use categories to organize them by context and folders to organize them by project or client. I also use search folders to find emails quickly by category or categories and filter by unreads. The reason for this is that I can clear categories after processing and in the mayorie of cases, I only need a quick review of the emails without the need to convert them into tasks.</p> <p>By following these steps, you can implement the GTD method in Outlook and Microsoft To Do and improve your productivity and focus.</p> <p>Good luck! \ud83c\udf40</p>","tags":["GTD"]},{"location":"blog/2024/12/22/gtd-in-outlook-with-microsoft-to-do/#references","title":"References","text":"<ul> <li>How to use Microsoft To Do for Getting Things Done (GTD)</li> <li>Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity</li> <li>Manage email messages by using rules in Outlook</li> <li>FileMeta</li> </ul>","tags":["GTD"]},{"location":"blog/2025/01/01/azure-cost-management-planifica-tu-presupuesto-2025/","title":"Azure Cost Management: planifica tu presupuesto 2025","text":"","tags":["Azure Cost Management","FinOps","Presupuestos","Optimizaci\u00f3n"]},{"location":"blog/2025/01/01/azure-cost-management-planifica-tu-presupuesto-2025/#azure-cost-management-planifica-tu-presupuesto-2025","title":"Azure Cost Management: planifica tu presupuesto 2025","text":"","tags":["Azure Cost Management","FinOps","Presupuestos","Optimizaci\u00f3n"]},{"location":"blog/2025/01/01/azure-cost-management-planifica-tu-presupuesto-2025/#resumen","title":"Resumen","text":"<p>enero es el mes para configurar presupuestos y alertas de costes en Azure.

The Network Manager only has delegated access to apply configurations within this defined scope boundary. Although you can directly define a scope on a list of subscriptions, it's recommended to use management groups for scope definition as they provide hierarchical organization to your subscriptions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Deployment of Configuration Types: After defining the scope, you deploy configuration types including Connectivity and SecurityAdmin rules for your Virtual Network Manager.</p> </li> <li> <p>Creation of Network Group: Post-deployment, you create a network group which acts as a logical container of networking resources for applying configurations at scale. You can manually select individual virtual networks to be added to your network group (static membership) or use Azure Policy to define conditions for dynamic group membership.</p> </li> <li> <p>Connectivity and Security Configurations: Next, you create connectivity and/or security configurations to be applied to those network groups based on your topology and security requirements. A connectivity configuration enables you to create a mesh or a hub-and-spoke network topology, while a security configuration lets you define a collection of rules that can be applied globally to one or more network groups.</p> </li> <li> <p>Deployment of Configurations: Once you've created your desired network groups and configurations, you can deploy the configurations to any region of your choosing.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Azure Virtual Network Manager can be deployed and managed through various platforms such as the Azure portal, Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or Terraform.</p>","tags":["Azure Virtual Network Manager"]},{"location":"blog/2025/01/24/azure-virtual-network-manager-a-comprehensive-guide/#key-benefits-of-azure-virtual-network-manager","title":"Key Benefits of Azure Virtual Network Manager","text":"<ul> <li>Centralized management of connectivity and security policies globally across regions and subscriptions.</li> <li>Direct connectivity between spokes in a hub-and-spoke configuration without the complexity of managing a mesh network.</li> <li>Highly scalable and highly available service with redundancy and replication across the globe.</li> <li>Ability to create network security rules that override network security group rules.</li> <li>Low latency and high bandwidth between resources in different virtual networks using virtual network peering.</li> <li>Roll out network changes through a specific region sequence and frequency of your choosing.</li> </ul>","tags":["Azure Virtual Network Manager"]},{"location":"blog/2025/01/24/azure-virtual-network-manager-a-comprehensive-guide/#use-cases-for-azure-virtual-network-manager","title":"Use Cases for Azure Virtual Network Manager","text":"<p>Azure Virtual Network Manager is a versatile tool that can be used in a variety of scenarios:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Hub-and-Spoke Network Topology: Azure Virtual Network Manager is ideal for managing hub-and-spoke network topologies where you have a central hub virtual network that connects to multiple spoke virtual networks.
